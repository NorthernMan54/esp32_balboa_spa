C: \ Users \ Username \ AppData \ Local\Arduino15\packages\esp32\tools\esp32-arduino-libs\idf-release_v5.1-bd2b9390ef\esp32s3.
4. DEMO_PIC、DEMO_MJPEG、 DEMO_MP3， These three sample tests must be inserted with a TF card.
Without a TF card, the screen will go black. The card needs to have corresponding files,The file names are pic, mjpeg, and music,
or you can directly copy the files we provide to the TF card.
